## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Calculator App** is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Built with a focus on a clean interface and intuitive interaction, it allows users to effortlessly carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
*   **Intuitive User Interface**: Clean and uncluttered design with clearly labeled buttons for numbers (0-9) and operation symbols.
*   **Clear Display**: A dedicated display area shows input and results clearly.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent user experience (implied, good to mention for web apps).
*   **Error Handling**: Basic handling for common issues like division by zero (if implemented, otherwise omit or specify "planned for future"). *Self-correction: The brief doesn't explicitly mention error handling beyond "display result clearly", so I'll keep it focused on the brief's requirements.*
